# (WORK IN PROGRESS) Python - Portfolio

The creation of this repo is to showcase my skills and knowledge in Python. It will be a growing repo, either by expanding on current projects or introducing new projects. Each project will be in its own folder within this repo, with files associated with each of the code included for ease of understanding, and displaying the result of the code.

Links to each of the project and the skills showcased will be listed below.
